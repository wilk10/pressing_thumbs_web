### It's just me!

My name is Anselmo. I come from Italy but have been living in Berlin since 2018.
<br />
<br />
After many years working as a software engineer I decided to follow my real passion
and started to make video games.
<br />
<br />
Pressing Thumbs is the name of my studio. It comes from the German's equivalent
of "crossing the fingers".
<br />
<br />
I use [Bevy Engine](https://bevyengine.org) and [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) programming language to make my games.
