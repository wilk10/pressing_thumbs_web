# Pressing Thumbs Games

<br>

![A picture of me](./photo.png)

My name is Anselmo. I come from Italy but have been living in Berlin since 2018.
<br>
<br>
I worked for many years as a software engineer, but I always felt I wanted to implement my own ideas,
and give my creativity an outlet, while still using my coding skills. So I have decided to make video games.
<br>
<br>
I am currently working on my first commercial game. It's a City-Builder set during the Industrial Revolution.

You can see how it looks on my [Mastodon](https://mastodon.online/@elmowilk) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ElmoSampedro) accounts.

<br>
_Pressing Thumbs_ is the name of my studio. It comes from the German's equivalent
of "crossing the fingers".
<br>
<br>
I use [Bevy Engine](https://bevyengine.org) and the [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) programming language to make my games.
