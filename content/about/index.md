# Pressing Thumbs Games

<br>

![A picture of me](./photo.png)

My name is Anselmo. I come from Italy but have been living in Berlin since 2018.
<br>
<br>
I worked for many years as a software engineer, but I always felt I wanted to implement my own ideas
and use my creativity, together with my coding skills. So I have decided to make video games.
<br>
<br>
I am working on [Times of Progress](/times-of-progress). It's a City Builder set during the Industrial Revolution.
You can wishlist it on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2628450/Times_of_Progress/).
<br>
<br>
_Pressing Thumbs_ is the name of my studio. It comes from the German's equivalent of "crossing the fingers".
<br>
<br>
I use [Bevy Engine](https://bevyengine.org) and the [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) programming language to make my games.
